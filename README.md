# Jagga-Tax-Problem
This repository contains a JavaScript implementation for solving the "Jagga Tax" coding challenge. The challenge involves finding the top five strategic crossings to collect a fictional "Jagga Tax" in a network of roads and crossings, based on the number of shortest routes passing through each crossing.
